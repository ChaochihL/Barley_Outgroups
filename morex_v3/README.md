# Barley Outgroups relative to Morex v3

The methods used below are for mapping the barley outgroups to Morex v3 (barley reference genome). For info on where the samples came from, see the main `README.md` file on this page https://github.com/ChaochihL/Barley_Outgroups.

# Methods

As of 2021-03-11 the README.md file in this subdirectory are the steps used to generate outgroup fasta files relative to Morex v3.

We will use already trimmed fastq files from previous processing. Please see [Morex_v2 README Step 00: Downloading samples and data preparation](https://github.com/ChaochihL/Barley_Outgroups/tree/master/morex_v2) for specfics on how we chose these sequences to use and how they were adapter trimmed.
